# Computational Microbial Genomics project

This project is part of the course of Computational Microbial Genomics, held by Nicola Segata (A.Y. 2021-2022).

The analysis starts from a pool of Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) and is divided into:

- Genome annotation
- Pangenome analysis
- Phylogenetic structure
- Taxonomic annotation
- Association with host data
