However, there are many more publicly available MAGs from ruminants. In this paper, for the first time, all available resources are combined, catalogued and de-replicated to define putative species-level bins. As well as providing new insights into the constitution of the rumen microbiome, including an updated estimate of the number of microbial species in the rumen, this work demonstrates that a lack of community-adopted standards for the release and annotation of MAGs hinders progress in microbial ecology and metagenomics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The estimation of the pangenome of a species is a solution to this issue as it provides an overview of genes that are shared by all strains and genes that are present in only some of the genomes. These different sets of genes can then be analyzed functionally to explore correlations with unique phenotypes and adaptations. This protocol presents the usage of Roary, a Linux-native pangenome application. Roary is a straightforward software that provides 1) an overview about core and accessory genes for those interested in general trends and, also, 2) detailed information on gene presence/absence in each genome for in-depth analyses.

abstract = {The genetic variability in bacterial species is much larger than in other kingdoms of life. The gene content between pairs of isolates can diverge by as much as 30\% in species like Escherichia coli or Streptococcus pneumoniae. This unexpected finding led to the introduction of the concept of the pan-genome, the set of genes that can be found in a given bacterial species. The genome of any isolate is thus composed by a “core genome” shared by all strains and characteristic of the species, and a “dispensable genome” that accounts for many of the phenotypic differences between strains. The pan-genome is usually much larger than the genome of any single isolate and, given the ability of many bacteria to exchange genetic material with the environment, constitutes a reservoir that could enhance their ability to survive in a mutating environment. To understand the evolution of the pan-genome of an important pathogen and its interactions with the commensal microbial flora, we have analyzed the genomes of 44 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, one of the most important causes of microbial diseases in humans. Despite evidence of extensive homologous recombination, the S. pneumoniae phylogenetic tree reconstructed from polymorphisms in the core genome identified major groups of genetically related strains. With the exception of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype, geographical site of isolation and disease outcome. The distribution of dispensable genes was consistent with phylogeny, although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this correlation in the case of ancient lineages. Homologous recombination, involving short stretches of DNA, was the dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of S. pneumoniae. Genetic exchange with related species sharing the same ecological niche was the main mechanism of evolution of S. pneumonia; and S. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity of S. pneumoniae. The pan-genome of S. pneumoniae increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the variability of the sample, suggesting that acquired genes accumulate proportionately to the age of clones.}

    abstract = { Abstract A reference genome is a high quality individual genome that is used as a coordinate system for the genomes of a population, or genomes of closely related subspecies. Given a set of genomes partitioned by homology into alignment blocks we formalize the problem of ordering and orienting the blocks such that the resulting ordering maximally agrees with the underlying genomes' ordering and orientation, creating a pan-genome reference ordering. We show this problem is NP-hard, but also demonstrate, empirically and within simulations, the performance of heuristic algorithms based upon a cactus graph decomposition to find locally maximal solutions. We describe an extension of our Cactus software to create a pan-genome reference for whole genome alignments, and demonstrate how it can be used to create novel genome browser visualizations using human variation data as a test. In addition, we test the use of a pan-genome for describing variations and as a reference for read mapping. }

abstract = {The development of efficient and inexpensive genome sequencing methods has revolutionized the study of human bacterial pathogens and improved vaccine design. Unfortunately, the sequence of a single genome does not reflect how genetic variability drives pathogenesis within a bacterial species and also limits genome-wide screens for vaccine candidates or for antimicrobial targets. We have generated the genomic sequence of six strains representing the five major disease-causing serotypes of Streptococcus agalactiae, the main cause of neonatal infection in humans. Analysis of these genomes and those available in databases showed that the S. agalactiae species can be described by a pan-genome consisting of a core genome shared by all isolates, accounting for ≈80\% of any single genome, plus a dispensable genome consisting of partially shared and strain-specific genes. Mathematical extrapolation of the data suggests that the gene reservoir available for inclusion in the S. agalactiae pan-genome is vast and that unique genes will continue to be identified even after sequencing hundreds of genomes.}}
